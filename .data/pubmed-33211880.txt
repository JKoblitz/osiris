TI  - BRENDA, the ELIXIR core data resource in 2021: new developments and updates.

AB  - The BRENDA enzyme database (https://www.brenda-enzymes.org), established in 1987, 
      has evolved into the main collection of functional enzyme and metabolism data. In 
      2018, BRENDA was selected as an ELIXIR Core Data Resource. BRENDA provides 
      reliable data, continuous curation and updates of classified enzymes, and the 
      integration of newly discovered enzymes. The main part contains >5 million data 
      for ∼90 000 enzymes from ∼13 000 organisms, manually extracted from ∼157 000 
      primary literature references, combined with information of text and data mining, 
      data integration, and prediction algorithms. Supplements comprise disease-related 
      data, protein sequences, 3D structures, genome annotations, ligand information, 
      taxonomic, bibliographic, and kinetic data. BRENDA offers an easy access to 
      enzyme information from quick to advanced searches, text- and structured-based 
      queries for enzyme-ligand interactions, word maps, and visualization of enzyme 
      data. The BRENDA Pathway Maps are completely revised and updated for an enhanced 
      interactive and intuitive usability. The new design of the Enzyme Summary Page 
      provides an improved access to each individual enzyme. A new protein structure 3D 
      viewer was integrated. The prediction of the intracellular localization of 
      eukaryotic enzymes has been implemented. The new EnzymeDetector combines BRENDA 
      enzyme annotations with protein and genome databases for the detection of 
      eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes.
