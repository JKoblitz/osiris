# OSIRIS Portfolio 

## FAQ

**Where can I edit the information that I see in Portfolio**

> Everything that can be seen in Portfolio is created and edited in OSIRIS. This includes all activities, but also profile information such as the CV and group membership.

**Which activities are displayed in Portfolio?**

> Publications have a special status in Portfolio, as they also have a special status in science. That is why they have their own tab and are always displayed. The *Activities* tab contains all lectures, posters, software & data, and awards by default. 

**How can I hide an activity if I don't want it to appear in Portfolio?**

> As long as you have the rights to edit an activity (e.g. because you are a (co-)author or have a corresponding role), you can hide an activity in Portfolio. To do this, click on the activity and activate the switch *Hide in Portfolio*. The activity should disappear from Portfolio immediately. You can undo this at any time by confirming the switch again.

**How can I highlight an activity on my profile?**

> As long as you are the author of the activity, you can highlight it on your profile under the tab *Highlighted Research*. It will then appear above all other activities in a separate area. To do this, click on the activity and activate the switch at *Highlight on your profile*. A green message should notify you of the success of this action. You can undo this at any time by confirming the switch again. Please note that this action also works for otherwise hidden activities, i.e. an activity that is hidden and highlighted will not be displayed in the overall list, but will still appear as highlighted research on your profile.

**How does Portfolio ensure that email addresses are not read by bots?**

> Bots that automatically read email addresses and use them for dubious business are a problem. For this reason, email addresses in Portfolio are protected at multiple levels. The entire Portfolio website is loaded via JavaScript, which makes it more difficult for bots to automatically read all the information. The email addresses are additionally encrypted when they are transferred to Portfolio, so even if a bot is able to read the page after it has been generated, it will only get gibberish back. Only when a user clicks on the *Show Mail* button will the email be decrypted and displayed. This should ensure that emails are accessible (you can copy or click on them to send emails without having to type them in), but that they cannot be read by bots. 

**What information about me does Portfolio display and how can I control this?**

> Portfolio is able to display the following information about you:
> - Your current position 
> - Your profile photo (hidden by default)
> - Your business phone number (hidden by default)
> - Your business email address
> - An additional email address you specify with a comment on when to use it
> - Social media links (currently supported are ORCID, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, ResearchGate and GoogleScholar)
> - Your CV and research interests
> - Your affiliation to organizational units
> - Your affiliation to projects
> - Your publications and other activities (sorted by date in descending order)
> - Your participation in courses
>
> You can control all this information. When you are on your profile, you can click on *Edit profile*.
> There you can control directly at *Organizational units* which **units** you belong to and also specify your **current position** in German and English.
> 
> There you will also find the section *Public display (portfolio)*. There you can do the following:
> - You can **hide your complete profile in the portfolio**. This will make you completely disappear from the portfolio website, your name will no longer be linked in the author lists and your profile page will no longer be shown. In this case, all other settings are irrelevant to you. You can undo this at any time by removing the check mark.
> - You can make your **profile picture** visible. By doing so, you confirm that Portolio may use and display it publicly. You can reverse this at any time.
> - You can change the visibility of the **email address** (visible by default). 
> - You can change the visibility of the **phone number** (hidden by default).
> - You can set an **alternative email address** with a comment. e.g.: *For requests regarding Digital Diversity, please contact* (comment) hub@dsmz.de (email).
>
> In the *Contact* section, you also have the option of providing social media profiles. Please note that these will always be shown, so if you do not want to show them publicly, you must not provide them.
>
> You can edit your **CV and research interests** by clicking on the *General* tab in your profile and then on the edit icon next to each heading.
> 
> Projects, activities and teaching events are also taken directly from OSIRIS and can be hidden there.
